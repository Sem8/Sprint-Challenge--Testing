1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

1an. The describe() breaks your test suite into components and creates a block that groups together several related tests. The it() is where you
perform individual tests


2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

2an. Purpose of test driven development is to generate well thought out, carefully planned out code. It helps to build testable code with tests that 
enable refactoring. I'm good with test driven development, but I prefer testing on postman rather than with writing tests because postman is so much
faster and easier. 


3. Mention three types of automated tests.

3an. Three types of automated tests include 1) UI regression test, 2) Unit test and 3) Integration test.
